          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is
            one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML
            and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
            web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All
            major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the
            code on users' devices.

          <h2>Python</h2>
          <p>
            Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. Its
            design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of
            significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented
            approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for
            small- and large-scale projects.

          <h2>Java</h2>
          <p>
            Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming
            language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies
            as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended
            to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that
            compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java
            without the need to recompile.
